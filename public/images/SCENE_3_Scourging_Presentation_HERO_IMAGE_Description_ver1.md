## Midjourney Prompt

```
First-century Roman Praetorium courtyard, Jerusalem, dawn breaking,
bloodied and scourged prisoner standing between Roman soldiers, flesh torn and streaming blood,
crown of thorns wrapped around head, blood flowing down face obscuring features,
rich purple robe draped across shoulders in mockery of royalty against the wounds beneath,
Roman soldiers surrounding the figure showing casual confidence in their authority,
crowd visible behind barriers, hundreds of faces turned toward the prisoner, mouths open in roar,
Roman prefect (Pontius Pilate) visible at side in white toga gesturing toward the condemned,
massive stone columns framing the scene suggesting the weight of Roman institutional power,
stone courtyard slick with blood and morning dew,
golden amber light breaking across the scene creating stark contrast between light and shadow on faces,
atmosphere of collective madness—crowd's unified bloodlust against prefect's attempt at detachment,
shot as historical documentary of crowd psychology and state power converging toward violence,
documentary realism capturing the moment before execution becomes inevitable,
historically accurate 1st century Roman-Judean architecture and military uniforms,
detailed worn purple cloth, blood-streaked features, weathered armor, fear and hunger visible in crowd faces,
creating the sense of institutional cruelty culminating in collective demand for death that absolves authority of individual responsibility

## Description

A brutally scourged and bleeding prisoner is presented before a roaring crowd, crowned with thorns and mocked in purple—a calculated display of Roman power designed to inspire pity that instead kindles bloodlust, as the crowd's unified demand for crucifixion overwhelms any appeal to mercy. Pilate washes his hands and absolves Rome of responsibility by distributing it to those who demanded the execution, establishing that cruelty functions most efficiently when perpetrators believe they are merely responding to collective will.
