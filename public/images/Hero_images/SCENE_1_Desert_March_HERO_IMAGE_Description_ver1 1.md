## Midjourney Prompt

```
First-century Roman military cohort marching through Judean wilderness landscape,
desert dawn with endless sandy terrain and twisted amber and rust-colored rock formations,
Roman soldiers in staggered two-row formation showing discipline and endurance,
centurion in foreground wearing worn bronze armor bearing marks of service,
vast empty desert suggesting isolation and vulnerability,
golden amber morning light creating long dramatic shadows across sandy basin,
atmosphere shifting from military precision to growing dread as horizon hints at distant smoke and carrion birds,
weathered cloth armor covering and worn leather fittings visible,
human faces showing exhaustion mixed with determination,
warm golden and deep shadow lighting throughout creating documentary atmosphere,
shot as historical documentary of Roman military march,
documentary realism capturing human cost of occupation,
historically accurate 1st century Roman military period and Judean landscape,
detailed worn wool, aged leather armor, sweat-darkened fabric, sand-covered boots,
creating the weight of soldiers marching toward unknown horror while maintaining discipline

## Description

A Roman cohort advances through the merciless Judean desert in disciplined formation, their armor burning in golden morning light as the landscape itself seems to whisper of the butchery awaiting them. By the scene's end, that discipline will shatter against the incomprehensible horror of systematic mutilation, forcing a centurion named Longinus to make a choice that will define him: to become obedient, to look away, to survive.
