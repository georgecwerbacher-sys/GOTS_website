## Midjourney Prompt

```
First-century Roman military parade ground, Jerusalem garrison, blazing afternoon sun,
Roman centurion (Longinus) in worn bronze armor throwing spear toward distant target, spear flying wide,
second centurion (Brutus) on horseback turning away with visible contempt and rejection,
smaller, predatory centurion (Corvus) watching with cold predatory hunger,
rows of Roman soldiers visible in background showing witness to humiliation,
hay target visible at distance showing the failed attempt,
harsh bright sunlight creating stark shadows emphasizing isolation and shame,
centurion's face showing desperation mixed with failing vision (visual blur suggested through composition),
warm golden and harsh white light clashing to show the shift from hope to dread,
shot as brutal military documentary capturing moment of personal destruction,
documentary realism showing human cost of perfection-demanding hierarchies,
historically accurate 1st century Roman military garrison setting,
detailed weathered armor, sweat-soaked fabric, dust rising from parade ground, visible anguish in body language,
creating the sense of a soldier's entire life ending in a single moment of public failure while his hope-giver turns away forever

## Description

A Roman centurion's failing vision betrays him in a public test, causing his spear to fly wide as his commander turns away in disgust—a moment that transforms him from a soldier of valor into a broken man reassigned to the Death Squad, where he will learn to perform systematic cruelty until his humanity is methodically dismantled. The breaking of Longinus begins not with a blade, but with the withdrawal of a father figure's approval.
