## Midjourney Prompt

```
First-century execution ground (Golgotha), darkness descending unnaturally at midday,
three wooden crosses silhouetted against darkened sky showing ominous unnaturalness,
central figure on middle cross with head bowed, body at absolute end of suffering,
Roman centurion (Longinus) positioned at base of central cross with spear raised,
moment of spear penetrating flesh capturing the instant before supernatural revelation,
blazing white-gold light bursting from the wound point reaching upward like pillar to heaven,
light so intense it cuts through darkness and illuminates faces in crowd with startling clarity,
man in fine delicate Sanhedrin garments visible in crowd, face transfixed by the light, understanding crystallizing visibly,
Roman soldiers visible reacting with shock—some shielding eyes, some on knees, some gripped by recognition,
earth trembling beneath them suggested by postures and composition,
light creating shadows so stark that reality itself seems to fracture into two dimensions,
warm golden light transformed into blazing white-gold sacred revelation,
shot as supernatural historical moment where divine judgment becomes visible through ordinary execution apparatus,
documentary realism meeting celestial manifestation without compromise to either,
historically accurate 1st century Roman military and Jewish dress visible despite supernatural element,
detailed worn spear, blood and water flowing, light refracting through particles in air, weathered faces showing awe and terror,
creating the sense that the veil between visible and invisible worlds has torn open at the moment of piercing, and what flows through is light that restores sight and transforms all who witness it

## Description

As darkness unnaturally descends over Golgotha, the centurion Longinus drives his spear through the crucified figure's side, and in that instant of piercing, blazing light bursts forth—restoring his failing sight and revealing divine judgment manifesting through an ordinary Roman execution. A man in Sanhedrin garments is marked by the light with devastating understanding, and the spear becomes not an instrument of death, but a conduit of revelation that transforms everyone who witnesses it, proving that the apparatus of state violence has met something incomprehensibly larger than itself.
