      "title": "Physical Description & Layout",
      "geographic_setting": "High desert plateau overlooking the Dead Sea; dramatic, austere, isolated landscape. The settlement sits on a dry marl plateau approximately 1.5 km from the Dead Sea shore, positioned at roughly 430 meters below sea level—Earth's lowest elevation. This creates an otherworldly, cut-off quality. Limestone cliffs riddled with caves surround the plateau; these caves became repositories for the Dead Sea Scrolls. Extreme desert conditions: summer 32-39°C, winter 20-23°C, under 50mm annual rainfall. Access via Wadi Qumran from the north, Dead Sea shore from the south, mountain passes westward toward Jerusalem (3-4 hour journey).",
      "scale": "Modest but purposefully organized—approximately 100 × 80 meters (large medieval monastery or small village size). Compact scale creates intimate community density. Cemetery 50 meters east with approximately 1,100 graves.",
      "natural_features": "Wadi Qumran seasonal stream feeding the aqueduct system; limestone cliffs and caves; salt formations along the Dead Sea shore; sparse vegetation; relentless sun. Plateau elevated above immediate shore, providing views and defensive advantage.",
      "primary_structures": "Scriptorium (upper-story room with plastered benches, 4-5 inkwells—scholarly heart); Dining Hall/Assembly Room (communal meals, ~1,000 serving vessels in pantry); Eight Mikva'ot (ritual baths fed by aqueduct, descent/ascent paths for purity); Potter's Workshop (two kilns, produces distinctive scroll jars); Tower (northwestern corner—defense, lookout, water storage); Cemetery (50m east). Aqueduct system channels water from Wadi Qumran—engineering marvel in the desert."

Purposeful, controlled, spiritually focused. The distinctive smell of the Dead Sea community—part ink, part mineral, part desert heat."
