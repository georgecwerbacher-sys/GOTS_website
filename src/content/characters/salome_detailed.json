    "why_readers_care": "Salome represents the power of those society overlooks. Her character demonstrates how strategic invisibility becomes operational strength, how women's overlooked status enables them to protect what visible leaders cannot. Readers watch her build networks, protect the spear, and teach other women to claim their power. Her faith comes from direct encounter rather than doctrine, making her certain and unafraid. Through Salome, readers see how the most essential work often happens in shadows, how those without formal authority can accomplish the impossible, and how grace works through the overlooked to preserve testimony.",
