    "why_readers_care": "Aquilus represents the ordinary person confronted by extraordinary truth. His character demonstrates that witnessing resurrection doesn't automatically produce faith or clear answers—sometimes it produces crisis and compromise. Readers are drawn to his integrity and reliability, even as they watch him face an impossible choice between truthfulness and loyalty. His decision to accept the bribe and lie creates moral crisis that illustrates the real-world consequences of resurrection for ordinary people. Through Aquilus, readers see how absolute integrity may be impossible, but compromise without principle is equally destructive.",
