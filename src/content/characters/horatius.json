    "full_description": "Horatius is a senior intelligence officer in the Arcani — Roman secret service operating in the shadows of political power. Known as \"The Bloodhound\" and \"The Interrogator,\" he has spent 25 years doing what others wouldn't: interrogation, extraction, making problems disappear. He appears unremarkable — plain dress, deliberate movement, the quality of someone who has been watching before anyone knew he arrived. The work has become escape from introspection. The conscience he believes he buried long ago is not dead; it has been working in silence. His reckoning — whether redemption through sacrifice or descent into cynicism — is coming due.",
