    "full_description": "Horatius is a Roman enforcement officer and interrogator known for absolute obedience and effectiveness in harsh measures. He appears as a necessary enforcer doing Rome's dirty work, but beneath this appearance lies a man becoming progressively dehumanized. Every cruelty he inflicts costs him a piece of humanity. Every order he follows without question hardens him further. His arc isn't about revelation of hidden nature—it's about transformation into something inhuman. By Part 3, he must choose between complete dehumanization or reclaiming his humanity, but either outcome is devastating.",
