    "why_readers_care": "Horatius represents the horrifying cost of being a tool of oppression. His character demonstrates that those who perpetrate systematic cruelty become dehumanized themselves. Readers watch his progressive transformation from efficient enforcer to something increasingly inhuman. His psychological crisis—the breaking down of compartmentalization that allows him to function—creates tension about whether he will reclaim his humanity or lose it completely. Through Horatius, readers see how efficiency in cruelty requires avoiding humanity, but humanity tries to surface.",
