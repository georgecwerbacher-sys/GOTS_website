    "why_readers_care": "Cestius represents the tragic figure whose destruction is orchestrated while he believes he's making free choices. His character demonstrates how pride and insecurity work together to create vulnerability to corruption. Readers are drawn to his genuine military experience and physical courage, even as they watch him make decisions that feel logical but are fundamentally flawed. His tragedy—competence undermined by fundamental limitations and corrupted judgment—becomes part of the larger story of how free will is compromised. Through Cestius, readers see how confidence is not the same as competence, and that accepting false intelligence and following flawed strategy have catastrophic consequences.",
