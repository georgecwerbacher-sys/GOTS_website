    "why_readers_care": "Brutus represents the insidious nature of evil—not obvious villainy but calculated predation hidden behind a perfect mask. His character demonstrates how those we trust can be our greatest enemies. His relationship with Longinus is particularly devastating: he appears as mentor and protector while systematically positioning Longinus for destruction. Through Brutus, readers see how deception can be more effective than obvious cruelty, and how trust can be weaponized.",
