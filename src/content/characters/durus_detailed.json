      "full_name": "Aulus Petronius Durus",
      "alternative_names": ["Durus"],
      "role": "Redeemed soldier; protector of Hannah and Menahem; guardian-in-training",
      "category": "Romans / Followers (transitional)",
      "story_status": "Book 2 forward — central to Part 1 and beyond",
      "time_period_active": "~36 CE — Book 2 forward",
      "primary_narrative_function": "The Roman who crossed over; living proof that the spear's call reaches even those who served its enemies"
    },
    "physical_description": {
      "age": "~30 years old",
      "build": "Solidly built — proportioned for endurance rather than brute force. Broad shoulders, lean midsection. The build of a man who has marched and fought for a decade. Nothing wasted.",
      "distinctive_features": {
        "scars": "Latticework of scars across both forearms. Hands calloused from gladius grip.",
        "posture": "Soldier's posture that survives even after the uniform is buried: spine straight, weight balanced, eyes moving to exits without conscious thought. Sun-darkened skin. Jaw sets hard when thinking through something difficult."
      },
      "typical_dress": "At story entry — rough undertunic, all Roman identification stripped and buried in the desert. As he settles: coarse linen tunic, leather belt, worn sandals. He keeps his gladius — the one thing he did not bury.",
      "bearing": "Commands quiet attention without seeking it. Others unconsciously arrange themselves in relation to where he stands. Does not perform authority — it simply inhabits him.",
      "voice": "Low, measured, deliberate. Few words. Does not fill silence. Does not hedge. Speaks in declarative statements. When something costs him emotionally, his voice does not break — it goes very quiet."
    },
    "background_history": {
      "family_background": "Roman provincial family — practical people who saw the military as a career path, not a calling. Father was a former soldier. Durus entered service accordingly.",
      "defining_childhood": "Age twelve — witnessed Rome seize a local family's land for a garrison. First understanding that the machinery he was preparing to join operated without reference to what was right. He filed the knowledge somewhere he could not act on it and kept walking toward enlistment.",
      "education_training": "Standard Roman military training. Exceptional in discipline, tactical assessment, and endurance. Leadership potential consistently identified — consistently unrealized, because commanders read his moral hesitation as limitation rather than quality.",
      "key_life_events": "Ten years of service accumulating moral weight. The massacre at Mount Gerizim — the moment the body refused what the mind had been overriding for a decade. Five days of desert. The community at Qumran. Margaret's words. The children.",
      "turning_points": "Mount Gerizim — the arm that would not fall. The hinge point of his entire life. Everything before it was the approach. Everything after is the consequence.",
      "current_circumstances": "The calling — a pull northwest he trusted because dying with a clear conscience was better than the alternative. His former life is gone — the uniform buried, Rome wants him dead. What replaces it depends entirely on whether transformation is real, whether these people will have him, and whether he can be what Hannah and Menahem need."

    "relationships": {
      "primary": [
        {"name": "Hannah (age 4)", "dynamic": "The child he nearly killed. She requires something concrete and daily from him. Her trust, when it comes, will cost him more than he expects."},
        {"name": "Menahem (age 3)", "dynamic": "Quieter than his sister. Watches from behind Hannah. Durus recognizes in Menahem's watchfulness the same instinct he has himself — the assessment before commitment. He respects it without yet knowing how to reach it."},
        {"name": "Margaret", "dynamic": "The woman who placed her body between his blade and the children. She named what he is supposed to become before he knew the words for it. He owes her a debt she has not asked him to repay.", "character_id": "margaret"}

        {"name": "Malchus", "dynamic": "Durus recognizes authority when he encounters it — not Roman authority, but the other kind. He does not yet have language for what Malchus carries. Soldier's instinct tells him to pay attention.", "character_id": "malchus"},
        {"name": "The community at Qumran", "dynamic": "They know what he is. Some will never fully trust him. He understands this as fair. He does not ask for trust — he shows up, does the work, and lets time do what persuasion cannot."}

      "how_they_connect": "Slowly. Through demonstrated reliability rather than words. Seeks usefulness — and through usefulness, belonging.",

    "motivations": {
      "what_drives_them": "The weight of what he has done, converted from paralysis into purpose. He cannot undo Mount Gerizim. He can decide what he does next.",

      "what_they_actually_need": "To understand that transformation is not earned through sufficient suffering or service — it is received. He is trying to work his way to redemption. He has not yet understood that it comes the other direction.",

      "entry_state": "Five days out of the desert. Nothing left. Standing at the edge of the community with the knowledge of what he did and nowhere else to go.",

      "main_problem": "Learning to receive what cannot be earned. Learning to be a father to children whose parents he may have killed. Learning that transformation is not a transaction.",

        "act_two": "The daily work of becoming what Margaret named. The children's wariness slowly becoming trust. Guilt running underneath. The Roman in him surfacing at wrong moments.",
        "act_three": "A moment that tests whether the transformation is real or whether, under pressure, the Roman returns. What is he, actually, when everything is on the line?",
        "act_four": "He is the man Margaret named. Not because he earned it — because he showed up, every day, and let the transformation happen to him."

His arc demonstrates that conscience cannot be buried forever; the body that refused at Mount Gerizim knew something the mind had been overriding for a decade. Readers watch a man of discipline learn that the most important things cannot be achieved through discipline alone. Through Durus, readers see redemption as gift rather than transaction, and what it means to become the man someone named before you had the words for it.",
