    "full_description": "Longinus is the centurion who pierced Christ's side at the crucifixion—present at the death he helped inflict, yet transformed by the mercy he witnessed there. A skilled soldier in Brutus's cohort, he is haunted by progressively failing eyesight that he desperately hides. Rising from Rome's gutters through wit and skill, he built his identity around Brutus's approval and his role as a soldier. His physical deterioration parallels his psychological fragmentation under the Death Squad's systematic torture. Through his participation in Christ's death, mercy breaks his mechanical numbness; divine light restores his sight alongside his spiritual awakening, making him the spear-bearer of that transformative moment.",
