    "full_description": "The Raven is a strategic architect of Rome's operations in Jerusalem. Born in Lugdunum to a Gallic warrior who allied with Rome, Corvus grew up between two identities, belonging fully to neither. He chose Rome with full awareness. As Brutus's second-in-command for five years, he is the intellect behind Brutus's authority \u2014 and both know it. His ambition to surpass Brutus is carefully managed; his suppressed Gallic heritage surfaces only in dangerous moments. The crucifixion is a strategic operation executed with precision. What follows will dismantle the framework he has built his entire identity inside.",
