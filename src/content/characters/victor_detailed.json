    "why_readers_care": "Victor represents the innocent corrupted by impossible circumstances. His character demonstrates that witnessing resurrection doesn't automatically produce faith or clear answers—sometimes it produces crisis, confusion, and forced choices. Readers are drawn to his genuine goodness and youthful enthusiasm, even as they watch him face impossible moral choices. His tragedy—the loss of innocence through forced participation in brutality and supernatural events—becomes part of the larger story of how different people respond to divine truth. Through Victor, readers see how youth and inexperience make someone vulnerable to manipulation and corruption, while innocence is both asset and liability.",
