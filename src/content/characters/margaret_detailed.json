Her character demonstrates how one moment of divine intervention—throwing herself between children and soldiers—transformed her entire life into a mission of protection. Readers watch her raise two children she saved, one choosing grace (Hannah) and one choosing violence (Menahem), embodying the ultimate theological question: does grace determine response, or do those saved remain free to reject salvation? Through Margaret, readers see how loss can be transformed into protection, how maternal love extends to community, and how archives preserve witness that would otherwise be lost.",
